## Implementation Plan

Brief: convert the attached Implementation Plan into a phased, actionable roadmap with milestones, deliverables, acceptance criteria, risks, and quality gates.

### Requirements checklist

- Read the attached `Implementation Plan.pdf` and extract scope: Done
- Produce a phased implementation plan with phases, milestones, deliverables, tasks, estimates: Done
- Include acceptance criteria, risks/mitigations, quality gates and next steps: Done

### Assumptions

- Small cross-functional team (1–3 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM)
- Two-week sprint cadence unless otherwise specified
- Cloud provider and exact infra choices will be decided during Phase 0

### Contract (inputs / outputs / success)

- Inputs: `Implementation Plan.pdf`, stakeholder priorities, existing repo
- Outputs: phased roadmap, backlog-ready user stories (next step)
- Success criteria: stakeholders can start sprint planning from this plan

### Top edge cases

- Missing or changing third-party integrations
- High traffic spikes during events
- Data-privacy / compliance not yet specified

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Alignment & Discovery (1 sprint)

Goal: confirm scope, acceptance criteria, constraints and produce a prioritized backlog.
Deliverables:

- Stakeholder sign-off document
- Prioritized product backlog with EPICs and top user stories
- Architecture Decision Record (ARD)
  Key tasks:
- Kickoff workshop (1 day)
- Requirements gap analysis (2 days)
- Create backlog & define MVP scope (2 days)
  Acceptance criteria:
- Stakeholder sign-off on backlog and MVP
- ARD created with chosen tech stack and constraints
  Risks & mitigations:
- Ambiguous requirements → list assumptions, get sign-off, timebox decisions

### Phase 1 — Architecture & Core Infrastructure (1–2 sprints)

Goal: establish repo structure, CI, dev infra and core service skeleton.
Deliverables:

- Repo layout and CI pipeline (lint, tests)
- Local-first infra (docker-compose) and basic IaC for cloud
- API skeleton and DB schema/migrations
  Key tasks:
- Setup CI and code quality checks
- Implement service skeletons and sample endpoints
- Design data model and migrations
  Acceptance criteria:
- CI pipeline passes on PRs
- Services run locally and migrations apply
  Risks & mitigations:
- Unknown infra constraints → provide local-first setup and document differences

### Phase 2 — MVP Feature Implementation (2–4 sprints)

Goal: implement the minimal feature set required for an MVP as described in the PDF.
Deliverables:

- Backend APIs for core flows
- Frontend screens for primary user journeys
- Auth and basic integrations/mocks
  Key tasks:
- Backend: core endpoints, validation, unit tests
- Frontend: screens, routing, integration with backend
- Integrations: implement or mock external APIs
  Acceptance criteria:
- End-to-end MVP user journey works in staging
- Unit and integration tests for core flows
  Risks & mitigations:
- Third-party API constraints → build robust mocks and retry logic

### Phase 3 — Extended Features & Optimization (2–3 sprints)

Goal: add non-MVP features, performance improvements and UX polish.
Deliverables:

- Optional features (reports, admin UI, analytics)
- Caching, pagination, query optimization
  Key tasks:
- Implement additional endpoints and UI
- Add caching and performance improvements
  Acceptance criteria:
- Non-MVP features implemented and tested
- Performance targets met for expected load
  Risks & mitigations:
- Scope creep → re-prioritize backlog and gate by business value

### Phase 4 — Testing, Security & Compliance (1–2 sprints)

Goal: harden the system with QA, security scanning, and basic accessibility/privacy checks.
Deliverables:

- Test suite (unit, integration, basic E2E)
- Security audit results and remediation list
- Accessibility baseline (WCAG) checks
  Key tasks:
- Write E2E tests for critical flows
- Run SAST and dependency scans
- Fix high/critical findings
  Acceptance criteria:
- CI passes all tests
- No critical security findings
  Risks & mitigations:
- New security issues discovered → schedule remediation sprint

### Phase 5 — Deployment & Monitoring (1 sprint)

Goal: deploy to production, enable monitoring and runbooks.
Deliverables:

- Production IaC and CD pipeline
- Monitoring dashboards and alerts
- Runbook for common incidents
  Key tasks:
- Configure CI → CD for staging and prod
- Add logs, metrics, health checks
- Create and publish runbook
  Acceptance criteria:
- Successful production deploy with smoke tests passing
- Alerts configured for critical failures

### Phase 6 — Handover & Iteration (1 sprint + ongoing)

Goal: transfer knowledge, finalize docs and plan next roadmap.
Deliverables:

- Developer & operator docs, API docs
- Stakeholder demo and sign-off
- Roadmap for next iteration
  Key tasks:
- Prepare docs and run demo
- Create backlog for next quarter
  Acceptance criteria:
- Stakeholder acceptance and handover complete
- Team can operate and iterate independently

## Quality gates (applied across phases)

- CI build on every PR
- Lint/format enforcement
- Unit tests (required), integration tests for critical flows
- E2E for MVP flows
- SAST and dependency vulnerability scans
- Smoke tests post-deploy

## Rough timeline (example, adjust by team size)

- Discovery: 1 week
- Infra & skeleton: 2–4 weeks
- MVP build: 4–8 weeks
- Extensions & polish: 4–6 weeks
- Testing & deployment: 2–3 weeks
- Handover: 1 week
  Total: ~3–5 months depending on team size and priorities

## Next actions

1. Confirm team size and target deployment platform (cloud vs on‑prem).
2. Approve MVP scope — I can convert it into a sprint-by-sprint backlog and user stories.
3. If desired, generate an initial set of Jira/Trello-ready user stories and acceptance criteria.
